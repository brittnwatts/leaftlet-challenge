# leaftlet-challenge


This ReadMe serves to:
   1. Certify that this work is my own,
   2. Specify code source and its location in my 'leaflet-challenge' repository,
   3. Explain the process of the challenge

1. 
My name is Brittney Watts, and I am in the UNCC/EdX Data Analytics Bootcamp. This challenge is a product my own work with some additional help from a tutor, forums, and previous class assignments.

2. 
The source code is my interpretation of the information we have learned in class with some help from class activities, and here
is a breakdown of the locations of each element of my assignment:

leaflet-challenge:
   My task was to extract data from Earthquakes in the past 7 days from the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The USGS provides earthquake data in JSON format that is updated every 5 minutes.
   
3.
Steps:     

    - Gather the data from USGS GeoJSON Feed
    - Using leaflet, create a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the dataset based on the latitude and longitude.
    - create markers for the map that reflect the magnitude of the earthquakes by their size and the depth of the earthquakes by their color. 
        - The markers should be darker with greater depth and larger with greater magnitude.
    - Create popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when it is clicked. 
    - Create a legend that shows the depth of the earthquakes and their corresponding colors.


Thank you!
